# List the services that are automatically launched when the machine boots
# 
# The name given to this type of service is init script.
# 
# Note_1:
# All System V init scripts are stored in /etc/rc.d/init.d/ or /etc/init.d
# directory. These scripts are used to control system startup and shutdown.
# cat /etc/init.d/*
#
# Note_2:
# Upstart is an event-based replacement for the /sbin/init daemon which handles
# starting of tasks and services during boot, stopping them during shutdown and# supervising them while the system is running.i
# cat /etc/init/*
# 
# Note_3:
# systemd is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems. When
# run as first process on boot (as PID 1), it acts as init system that
# brings up and maintains userspace services.
# 
# the following cmd doesn't include the upstart jobs:
# vagrant@stretch:~$ sudo service --status-all
# [ - ]  console-setup.sh
# [ + ]  cron
# [ + ]  dbus
# [ - ]  hwclock.sh
# [ + ]  irqbalance
# [ - ]  keyboard-setup.sh
# [ + ]  kmod
# [ + ]  networking
# [ + ]  procps
# [ - ]  rsync
# [ + ]  rsyslog
# [ + ]  ssh
# [ - ]  sudo
# [ + ]  udev
# 
# so we would rather use the following cmd:
# vagrant@stretch:/$ systemctl list-units --type service
# or to also include inactive process:
# vagrant@stretch:/$ systemctl list-units --type service --all

LOAD   = Reflects whether the unit definition was properly loaded.
ACTIVE = The high-level unit activation state, i.e. generalization of SUB.
SUB    = The low-level unit activation state, values depend on unit type.

55 loaded units listed.
To show all installed unit files use 'systemctl list-unit-files'.
